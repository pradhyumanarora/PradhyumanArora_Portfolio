UIDesigner: SoftwareEngineer: Q: RESOLVED: Is the combination of Framer Motion + Tailwind CSS + Radix UI technically feasible for all the proposed animations and interactions?
SoftwareEngineer: UIDesigner: A: RESOLVED: Yes, this combination is excellent and highly compatible. Framer Motion provides powerful animation APIs, Tailwind offers utility-first styling with CSS variables for theming, and Radix UI gives us accessible headless components. All three work seamlessly together in Next.js 14. This stack will handle complex animations, responsive design, and accessibility requirements efficiently.

UIDesigner: SoftwareEngineer: Q: RESOLVED: Can we achieve the animated starfield background with particle effects without performance issues on mobile devices?
SoftwareEngineer: UIDesigner: A: RESOLVED: Yes, with optimization strategies. I'll implement using HTML5 Canvas with requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animations. For mobile performance: reduce particle count (500 on desktop, 200 on mobile), use CSS transform3d for GPU acceleration, implement viewport-based rendering (only animate visible particles), and provide a "reduced motion" fallback. We can also use Framer Motion's useReducedMotion hook to respect user preferences.

UIDesigner: SoftwareEngineer: Q: RESOLVED: Are the proposed Core Web Vitals targets (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1) achievable with the space theme animations?
SoftwareEngineer: UIDesigner: A: RESOLVED: Yes, absolutely achievable with proper implementation. I'll use Next.js Image component with priority loading for hero images, implement code splitting with dynamic imports, use CSS-in-JS with Tailwind for critical CSS inlining, lazy load animations below fold, and preload key fonts (Inter, Orbitron). Framer Motion's layout animations prevent CLS, and we'll use will-change CSS property strategically for GPU acceleration.

UIDesigner: SoftwareEngineer: Q: RESOLVED: Is the interactive skills constellation technically feasible using the selected tech stack?
SoftwareEngineer: UIDesigner: A: RESOLVED: Yes, very feasible. I'll create this using SVG with Framer Motion for animations. Skills will be positioned using force-directed graph algorithms (d3-force light implementation), connected by animated SVG paths. Hover interactions will trigger scale/glow effects using Framer Motion variants. The constellation will be responsive with adaptive positioning for mobile layouts. All interactions will be keyboard accessible following WCAG guidelines.

UIDesigner: SoftwareEngineer: Q: RESOLVED: Can we implement the holographic border effects for project cards efficiently with CSS/Tailwind?
SoftwareEngineer: UIDesigner: A: RESOLVED: Yes, efficiently implementable. I'll use CSS custom properties with Tailwind's arbitrary value support for gradient borders, CSS filters for the holographic effect, and transform-gpu for hardware acceleration. The effect combines linear-gradient backgrounds, backdrop-filter for glassmorphism, and box-shadow with multiple layers. Performance will be optimized using CSS containment and transform3d for GPU layers. Hover states will use Framer Motion for smooth transitions.
