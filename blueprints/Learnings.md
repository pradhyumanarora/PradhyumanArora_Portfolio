## Problem-Solving Learnings

### 1. CSS Circular Reference Resolution
**Problem**: `@apply border-border` causing compilation errors
**Root Cause**: Tailwind CSS variable referencing itself
**Solution**: Changed to `@apply border-slate-200` for proper border styling

**Learning**: Fresh cache clearing resolves most Next.js build inconsistencies

### 3. TypeScript Import Resolution
**Problem**: TypeScript showing "Cannot find module" errors for valid components
**Root Cause**: Development environment inconsistencies vs runtime compilation
**Solution**: Verified tsconfig.json path aliases and confirmed runtime works
**Learning**: Distinguish between TypeScript intellisense issues and actual compilation errors

### 4. Development Server Port Management
**Problem**: Port conflicts during development
**Solution**: Next.js automatic port detection (3000 â†’ 3001)
