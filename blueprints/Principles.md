## 1. Design-First Development Principles

### Principle: Always Start with Design
**Foundation**: "Never begin implementation without complete design understanding"

**Implementation Rules**:
- **MUST** read `blueprints/Design.md` before writing any code
- **MUST** check `blueprints/conversation.md` for pending clarifications
- **MUST** ask questions when specifications are unclear or missing
- **MUST** wait for design clarification before proceeding with ambiguous features

**Rationale**: Design-driven development prevents rework, ensures user experience quality, and maintains project vision consistency.

**Evidence**: Our space-themed portfolio achieved pixel-perfect implementation because design specifications were comprehensive and followed systematically.

## 2. Agent Collaboration Principles

### Principle: Structured Communication Protocol
**Foundation**: "Clear communication channels prevent project confusion and delays"

**Communication Framework**:
```
<Agent>: <TargetAgent>: <Type>: <Status>: <Content>
- Type: Q (Question) or A (Answer)  
- Status: PENDING or RESOLVED
- Content: Specific question or answer
```

**Documentation Rules**:
- **Primary Design Reference**: `blueprints/Design.md`
- **Communication Log**: `blueprints/conversation.md`
- **Learning Archive**: `blueprints/Learnings.md`
- **Principle Documentation**: `blueprints/Principles.md`

**Workflow Protocol**:
1. Check existing documentation before asking questions
2. Log all questions and answers with proper formatting
3. Mark items as RESOLVED when implemented
4. Update documentation when new learnings emerge

**Rationale**: Structured communication eliminates confusion, creates accountability, and builds institutional knowledge.

## 4. Problem-Solving Methodology Principles

### Principle: Systematic Debugging Approach
**Foundation**: "Methodical problem-solving prevents issue escalation and ensures complete resolution"

**Debugging Framework**:
1. **Error Identification**: Use diagnostic tools to identify specific issues
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Examine underlying causes, not just symptoms  
3. **Solution Research**: Investigate best practices and proven solutions
4. **Targeted Implementation**: Apply specific fixes rather than broad changes
5. **Validation Testing**: Verify fixes work and don't introduce new issues
6. **Documentation**: Record solutions for future reference

**Tool Utilization**:
- `get_errors` for TypeScript and compilation issues
- `get_terminal_output` for runtime and build problems  
- `semantic_search` for codebase understanding
- `read_file` for detailed code analysis

**Rationale**: Systematic debugging saves time, prevents recurring issues, and builds troubleshooting expertise.
